# Music generation using fractals

Surprisingly good output in under 200 lines of Python. Uses rising tension to manipulate rhythms and notes generated using a fractal pattern. Tempo is still an issue and sometimes you might need to play around with it based on the scale and style you're targetting.

## Sample output:

"Spanish"

"Arab"

"Pentatonic"

## Use as a composing aid aka EDM background generator :

Take the output. Layer it over octaves and use it drive some arps and pads , add a beat and enjoy.

You might need to adjust the temp and arp speed.

## Installation

Just run pip install midiutil and then run the script. 

Play output.mid on a nice instrument on your synth or DAW.
